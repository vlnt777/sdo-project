The folders inside this folder should contain all the products of your project.

For a classical academic project, this will be a peer-reviewed manuscript. Often, you will also give presentations and/or make posters based on your work.

The `manuscript` folder contains a template for an academic manuscript. The content of the template is structured as a report for a class, but you can easily replace it with whatever structure you need.

Most manuscripts these days have supplementary material, place those into the `supplement` folder. (You can have the supplement inside the `manuscript` folder or next to it, whatever is better for your setup).

Often, you might make/give a presentation on your work and make slides for that. An example is the `presentation` folder. 

Similarly, it is common to make posters to present at conferences. An example using Quarto is in the `poster` folder.

Often you need a library of references in bibtex format, as well as a CSL style file that determines reference formatting. Those files might be used by several of the products. They should be placed into the `assets` folder, or for presentations and posters, separately into their respective `media` folders.

You can add further folders. For instance, if you have multiple presentations or posters, you might want to create subfolders for each. 
Or you could have a `blog-post` folder if you plan to write a blog-post. It's up to you how to structure/organize, as long as it is somewhat logical and you document it. ideally, put a readme file in each folder to orient others/your future self on what is going on.

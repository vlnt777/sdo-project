This folder contains an example of a slide presentation using Quarto and the `revealjs` output format.

The general suggestion is to place figures/tables/Rds files etc. that are used in the presentation in the `media` folder.

You could also pull it from the main project `results` folder, but the advantage of copying them into `media` is that you have everything related to your presentation in one place, and if contentigures inside `results` continues to be changed/updated, you can ensure you have the version you used in your presentation by copying it into `media`.

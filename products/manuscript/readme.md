This folder contains a template for an academic manuscript. The content of the template is structured as a report for a class, but you can easily replace it with whatever structure you need.

Most manuscripts these days have supplementary material, place those into the `supplement` folder. (You can have the supplement inside the `manuscript` folder or next to it, whatever is better for your setup).

Figures/tables/etc. should be pulled from their respective locations by code, as shown in the example.

Based on what most journals want, it is generally best to have the main manuscript render to a Word file, and the supplement to a pdf. Deviations might be necessary, based on specific circumstances.
